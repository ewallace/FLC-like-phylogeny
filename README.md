# FLC-like-phylogeny

Phylogeny of FLC-like proteins from fungi and others

This repository is for analysis of FLC-like proteins including:
- S. cerevisiae Flc1 / Flc2 / Flc3
- S. pombe pkd2
- C. neoformans Flc1

The goals are to 
- learn about protein evolution, structure and function
- using multiple sequence alignments of the fungal proteins
- and phylogenetic analysis

The work is by Rachael Murray @RachaelMurray and Edward Wallace @ewallace
